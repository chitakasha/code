## Overview

Welcome to the Classical Modules section of the ChitAkasha project. This document serves as an introduction to the classical components that form the backbone of the ChitAkasha ecosystem. While the quantum modules handle the complex, non-deterministic aspects, the classical modules are designed to manage deterministic, well-defined tasks.

---

## Purpose

The purpose of the classical modules is to:

- Provide a stable and reliable framework for the ChitAkasha project.
- Handle tasks that do not require quantum computation, such as data storage, user interface, and more.
- Serve as a bridge between the quantum and classical realms, facilitating seamless interaction.

---

## Components

The classical modules are divided into several key components:

- **C-Core**: The core algorithms and functionalities.
- **C-Utils**: Utilities and helper functions.
- **C-Data**: Data storage and management.
- **C-Tests**: Unit tests for validating the integrity of the classical modules.

---

## Installation

To install the classical modules, navigate to the `C-Core` directory and run the installation script:

```bash
cd C-Core/
./install.sh
```

For more detailed installation instructions, please refer to `DocC-Installation.md`.

---

## Usage

To use the classical modules, you can import them into your Python scripts as follows:

```python
from C_Core import SomeClassicalFunction
```

For more detailed usage instructions and examples, please refer to the specific documentation for each module.

---

## Contributing

We welcome contributions to the classical modules. If you would like to contribute, please follow the guidelines outlined in `CONTRIBUTING.md`.

---

## License

The classical modules of the ChitAkasha project are licensed under the MIT License. For more details, please refer to the `LICENSE` file.
