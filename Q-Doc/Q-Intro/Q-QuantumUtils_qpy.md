Certainly! Below is a sample Python script that you can use as the content for `Utils/Q-Utils/Q-QuantumUtils.qpy`. This script includes utility functions that could be useful for quantum operations in the ChitAkasha project.

```python
#!/usr/bin/env python3

import qiskit
from qiskit import QuantumCircuit, transpile, Aer, IBMQ
from qiskit.providers.ibmq import least_busy
from qiskit.tools.monitor import job_monitor
from qiskit.visualization import plot_histogram

def initialize_quantum_circuit(n_qubits):
    """
    Initialize a quantum circuit with n_qubits.
    """
    qc = QuantumCircuit(n_qubits)
    return qc

def apply_hadamard_gate(qc, qubit_index):
    """
    Apply a Hadamard gate to a specific qubit in the quantum circuit.
    """
    qc.h(qubit_index)

def apply_cnot_gate(qc, control_qubit, target_qubit):
    """
    Apply a CNOT gate between a control qubit and a target qubit.
    """
    qc.cx(control_qubit, target_qubit)

def measure_qubit(qc, qubit_index, classical_bit):
    """
    Measure a specific qubit and store the result in a classical bit.
    """
    qc.measure(qubit_index, classical_bit)

def execute_circuit(qc, backend='qasm_simulator', shots=1024):
    """
    Execute the quantum circuit on a specific backend.
    """
    # Use Aer's qasm_simulator
    simulator = Aer.get_backend(backend)

    # Transpile the circuit for the simulator
    compiled_circuit = transpile(qc, simulator)

    # Run the simulated job
    job = simulator.run(compiled_circuit, shots=shots)

    # Get the result
    result = job.result()

    return result

# Example usage
if __name__ == "__main__":
    # Initialize a 2-qubit quantum circuit
    qc = initialize_quantum_circuit(2)

    # Apply Hadamard gate to the first qubit
    apply_hadamard_gate(qc, 0)

    # Apply CNOT gate between the first and second qubit
    apply_cnot_gate(qc, 0, 1)

    # Measure both qubits
    qc.measure_all()

    # Execute the circuit
    result = execute_circuit(qc)

    # Get and display the counts
    counts = result.get_counts(qc)
    print("Counts:", counts)
    plot_histogram(counts).show()
```

This script includes utility functions for initializing a quantum circuit, applying Hadamard and CNOT gates, measuring qubits, and executing the circuit. It also includes an example usage section that demonstrates how to use these utility functions.

Feel free to modify this script to better suit the specific needs of the ChitAkasha project. Would you like to proceed with anything else?
